tips: <ul><li><strong>What's in the folders</strong> - The data files are organised in folders by country and contains:<ul><li>Excel files of summary data for a specific year. Some are “proxy” files, with aggregate data, as we await the full summary data sheet from the implementing country.</li><li>The EITI Report that is the basis of the Summary Data.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sources of the data</strong> - Recent data has been provided by Independent Administrators and National Secretariats of the EITI, while data from older reports are continuously being compiled by the International Secretariat itself.</li><li><strong>Data quality </strong> - Implementing countries are responsible for ensuring that this data is accurate. For detailed information, you may consult the original reports. Where figures are not available in US dollars, the annual average exchange rate is used.</li><li><strong>Not all files are in English</strong> - whenever applicable, the language used in the files is indicated in the file name by a two-letter code (e.g. EN - English, FR - French, DE - German).</li><li><strong>Not all PDF reports have the same tables</strong> - not all reports have the same tables or have them on the same pages, utilize the table of contents and list of tables to determine if the data you are looking for is in the report.</li></ul>
