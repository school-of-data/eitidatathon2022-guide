  <h1>What will you find in this guide</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="#scenarios"><strong class="color-primary-1">Each scenario</strong></a> is documented in its own page with contextual information, links to suggested datasets and tips on how to best approach the scenario. The datathon <a href="#faq"><strong class="color-primary-1">FAQ</strong></a> is also accessible from this website and will be updated throughout the process. Lastly, you are also able to <a href="#submit-proposal"><strong class="color-primary-1">submit your proposal</strong></a> from this website. So keep the tab open!
  </p>

  <h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="color-primary-1"><u>This is not a hackathon</u>:</strong> this event is called datathon as we expect every proposal to make use of EITI data. But this is also a design challenge: more than the technical sophistication of the proposal, we are looking for proposals that match the chosen scenario by taking into accounts the users and beneficiaries of your proposed solution.</li>
      <li><strong class="color-primary-1"><u>No extractives industry expertise required</u>:</strong> we encourage anyone with data, design or coding skills to consider submitting a solution. Knowing the sector will help navigate the data quicker, but having an external perspective can also be an asset! After all, the ‘pain points’ behind each scenario are still unsolved.</li>
      <li><strong class="color-primary-1"><u>We do not expect perfect solutions</u>:</strong> the focus of this event is on prototyping ideas, rather than creating perfect tools. If your idea is pre-selected, you will also have access to several mentors to help you refine your solution, before the final event.</li>
      <li><strong class="color-primary-1"><u>Work in teams!</u>:</strong> It can be challenging to address all aspects of the scenario alone: someone with data modeling skills may not have design skills and inversely. If you can come up with a good proposal but lack a team to prototype it, we will help you.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Our selection criteria are listed below</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Relevance to the chosen scenario - <strong class="color-primary-1">25%</strong></li>
      <li>Relevance to EITI data - <strong class="color-primary-1">25%</strong></li>
      <li>Clarity and feasibility of the proposed solution - <strong class="color-primary-1">25%</strong></li>
      <li>Clarity of the user-centric design elements - <strong class="color-primary-1">15%</strong></li>
      <li>Ability of the applicant (individual or team) to prototype the solution - <strong class="color-primary-1">10%</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Prizes will be awarded to the winners</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong class="color-primary-1">top four proposals</strong> will have the opportunity to pitch their tool at an EITI event.</li> 
      <li>The <strong class="color-primary-1">best proposal overall</strong>, as voted by the judges, will also have the opportunity to nominate a representative from their team to present their tool at the <strong class="color-primary-1">EITI Global Conference in Dakar, Senegal in June 2023</strong>. Depending on the team, more than one representative may be selected. The representative(s) will have the opportunity to attend the three day conference with airfare and accommodation covered by the EITI.</li>
      <li>Selected proposals will also have the opportunity to take part in a Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) <a href="https://resourcegovernance.org/learning/training">training</a>. More information on the training and the EITI event will be provided at a later date.</li>
