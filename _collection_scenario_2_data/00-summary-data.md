name: Summary Data from EITI Reports

where: The data is shared freely in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9Bl74fkjArzcWtDMDE3eUtYajA">this Google Drive</a> as per <a href="https://beta.eiti.org/standard/open-data-policy">EITI's Open Data Policy</a>.
tips: ["<strong>What's in the folders</strong> - The data files are organised in folders by country and contains:<ul><li>Excel files of summary data for a specific year. Some are “proxy” files, with aggregate data, as the full summary data sheet from the implementing country are not yet available.</li><li>The EITI Report that is the basis of the Summary Data.</li></ul>","<strong>Summary data templates</strong> - the summary data spreadsheets available from the folder use two template versions depending on the year of the report—most reports from 2018 use version 2.0 while those prior to 2018 use version 1.1. Always refer to the Introduction tab (usually the first one) of each summary data spreadsheet to determine what version is used and what information each of the tabs contain.","<strong>Sources of the data</strong> - Recent data has been provided by Independent Administrators and National Secretariats of the EITI, while data from older reports are continuously being compiled by the International Secretariat itself.", "<strong>Data quality </strong> - Implementing countries are responsible for ensuring that this data is accurate. For detailed information, you may consult the original reports. Where figures are not available in US dollars, the annual average exchange rate is used.", "<strong>Not all files are in English</strong> - whenever applicable, the language used in the files is indicated in the file name by a two-letter code (e.g. EN - English, ES - Spanish, FR - French, DE - German).", "<strong>Not all PDF reports have the same tables</strong> - not all reports have the same tables or have them on the same pages, utilize the table of contents and list of tables to determine if the data you are looking for is in the report."]
