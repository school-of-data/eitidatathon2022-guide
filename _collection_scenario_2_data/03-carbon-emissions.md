name: Carbon emissions data
what: "Conversion factor for oil and gas production to CO2 per MT"
where: You can find this data at&#58; <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator">US EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator</a> or the <a href="https://carbontracker.org/">Carbon Tracker Initiative</a>.  
tips: ["The <a href='https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator'>Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator</a> allows you to convert emissions or energy data to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from using that amount. The calculator helps you translate abstract measurements into concrete terms you can understand, such as the annual emissions from cars, households, or power plants. This calculator may be useful in communicating your greenhouse gas reduction strategy, reduction targets, or other initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "A <a href='https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Je48c1ZAT9G4FuccnOQnooQIVO-JGlVp?usp=sharing'>Carbon Tracker Calculator</a> from Carbon Tracker is also available."]
