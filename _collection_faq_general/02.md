question: How does the EITI promote transparency and accountability in the oil, gas and mining sectors?
answer: By becoming a member of the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), countries commit to disclose information along the extractive industry value chain – from how extraction rights are awarded, to how revenues make their way through government and how they benefit the public. Through participation in the EITI, more than 50 countries have agreed to a common set of rules governing what has to be disclosed and when – the EITI Standard.<br><br>As the energy transition gains traction, it will have a transformative impact on the extractive industries and global economy. The EITI Standard can play a role in building awareness of how the transition will affect extractive sector activities and revenues and in supporting the responsible and transparent production of minerals that are critical for a sustainable future. The EITI provides data that can help identify and close channels for corruption – not only in mining, oil and gas but increasingly in the renewables sector.<br><br>In each country that has joined the EITI, a multi-stakeholder group, composed of government, companies and civil society, supports implementation of the EITI Standard.
