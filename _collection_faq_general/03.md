question: Why is EITI hosting an open call?
answer: "In many countries, including those where the EITI is implemented, there are barriers to analysis of EITI data being undertaken in a way that can inform public debate on the energy transition. These include: <ul><li>Lack of awareness on available data and how it can be used.</li><li>Low capacity to analyse and present data in a way that informs policy decisions and public debate.</li><li>The absence of high-quality analysis and visualisations to serve as models.</li><li>Lack of awareness of the potential role of EITI data in informing the transition.</li></ul>EITI is hosting an open call to help address these barriers and generate awareness, understanding and examples of data analysis and visualisation to showcase across EITI implementing countries."
